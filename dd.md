# Problem(1/2) Big data scalability
- IoT sensors generates Big data on Premise
- Big data == Raw (sensor) data
- IoT platform on Cloud collects Big data from IoT sensors
- Collecting Big data is expensive all the way
- IoT sensor <-> Gateway <-> MBS <-> Cloud <-> IoT platform <-> ML
- Overloaded IoT platforms cannot process exploding Big data

.footnote[[Edge computing cannot solve everything!!](#gap)]
---
# Problem(2/2) Privacy awareness
- IoT sensor generates Privacy data on Premise (e.g. face images)
- Privacy data == Raw data
- ML processes Private data on Cloud
- Customers are concerned about privacy issue on Cloud
- ML cannot run on IoT sensors, too big!!

# Solution: tiny ML on IoT sensors
- Squeeze plain ML -> tiny ML
- Run tiny ML on IoT sensors
- Tiny ML processes Raw data on IoT sensors
- Size: Raw Big data >> Processed data (e.g. GB vs Byte)
- No privacy concerns in Processed data
- No network traffic unless needed (e.g. emergency)
- Processing on IoT sensors would offload overloaded IoT platform


???
For example,
- Dumb camera sends image to Cloud.
- This image may include someone's face.
- Face images are privacy dadta.
- OTOH, Smart camera detects # of people in a room.
- Smart camera sends 1 byte of # of people to Cloud
- 1 byte doesn't include privacy
- 1 byte saves network bandwidth, compared with video streaming
- 1 byte saves battery life, TX >> computing

# The Offer: TinyML as-a-Service
- as-a-Service == Cloud service
- Find appropriate ML on Zoo (model archive)
- Customize ML per IoT sensor to run
- Squeeze ML -> tinyML
- Orchestrate tinyML onto IoT sensor
- Establishing ecosystem with [AI chip](#aichip) vendors

Not tied with any specific devices, but ecosystem oriented.

# Business Model
1. E/// charges Enterprises directly
 - subscription per IoT sensor
 - per data usage
 - per ML model
2. E/// charges Operator && Operator charges Enterprises
 - via IoT platform (e.g. IoT Accelerator)
 - TinyMLaaS == Optional service on IoTA

???
1. e.g. What's Tranxes' business, oneline
2. e.g. Telia case, smart building use

FIXME: Hanieh will provide fig here

# Market Potential (TAM)
- [**Shipments of TinyML Devices to Reach 2.5 Billion by 2030**](https://www.abiresearch.com/press/global-shipments-tinyml-devices-reach-25-billion-2030/)
- [**AI Chip Landscape**](#aichip)

???
Any IoT devices would be tinyML'rized.

Buy?

# Execution Plan
- APR: Porting TinyML FWK on IoT sensor
- MAY: Implementing TinyMLaaS on Cloud
- JUN: Training model on Cloud
- AUG: Porting model onto IoT sensor
- SEP: Lab testing
- OCT: Feild testing
- NOV: Pioneers Nest

---
# Investment ask
- Porting TinyML FWK on IoT sensor: 6M
- Implementing TinyMLaaS on Cloud: 6M
- Training model on Cloud: 2M
- Porting model onto IoT sensor: 2M
- Project management: 6M
- Azure: 6M

---
# Risk Assessment
- TinyML cannot fit in IoT sensor (microcontroller)
- TinyML doesn't have enough accuracy
- TinyML runs too slow to serve.

???
TinyML is the trade-off between performance, accuracy and size.
