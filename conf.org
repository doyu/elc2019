#+TITLE: Conference Plan for TinyMLaaS
#+AUTHOR: Hiroshi Doyu

* 2 topics
  Need Valid usecase?
  Comparison / Metrics
  1) LwAE
     - PS on LwAE on MirageOS on KVM at ML "training"
     - ???
  2) TinyMLaaS
     - ML compiler && TFLM on MirageOS on ESP32 at ML inference
     - Metrics

  Usecase: A hight Quality camera vs multiple cheap cameras, communicating/retraining

* What are missing?
  1) LwAE
     - Squeeze NN size? 100MB
     - How small is Owl inference on KVM?
  2) TinyMLaaS
     - Use Owl -> TF converter
     - Can Owl inference run on ESP32?

* Which conference?
  Any suggestion?
