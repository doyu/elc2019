#+TITLE: Conference Plan for TinyML as-a-Service

* TODO Which conference?
Any suggestion?
- ATC Jan 15th
- Eurosys Nov 4th
- OSDI

* TODO Split TinyMLaaS & LwAE?
  "split -> 2"
  - LwAE with sync
  - TinyML with ML compiler
   - DNN
   - non DNN?
     - type of Edge analytics


  2 Topics included:

** Training

ML compiler
*** MirageOS
On the top of FreeRTOS
*** ESP32
- Xtensa 32bit MCU
- Devkit costs $40
