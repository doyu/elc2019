#+TITLE: Conference Plan for TinyMLaaS
#+AUTHOR: Hiroshi Doyu

* Split TinyMLaaS into LwAE && TinyMLaaS
  TinyMLaaS includes 2 topics
  1) LwAE
     - PS on LwAE on MirageOS on KVM at ML training
  2) TinyML as-a-Service
     - ML compiler && TFLM on MirageOS on ESP32 at ML inference

* What are missing?
  1) LwAE
     - Squeeze NN size? 100MB
     - Owl inference on KVM
  2) TinyMLaaS
     - Use Owl -> TF converter
     - Owl inference on ESP32?

* Which conference?
  Any suggestion?
  1) ATC Jan 15th
  2) Eurosys Nov 4th
  3) OSDI
  4) [[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-network/cfp/emerging-intelligent-systems-and-smart-computational][Emerging Intelligent Systems and Smart Computational Technologies for Future IoT]]
