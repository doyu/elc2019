* Device upgrade
- Can run inference on the current device?
 - with INFXL?
 - Any plan to upgrade a device?
- FOTA support?
- LwM2M support
Preferably LwM2M client(inc. FOTA) should be supported in a sensor device.

[[../images/arch_003.png][FOTA: Flashing via LwM2M server]]

We could work around this effort of implementing LwM2M client in a device,
with running LwM2M client externally outside of a device
but connected via USB for flasing.

* Demo usecase
- Requirement: swap inference per condition
- Any suggestion?

* Workshop
