* Which devices to buy?

* LwM2M interface support
- (Ericsson) Ericsson will provide lightweight M2M support as the interface between Skymizer and Ericsson

* Which demo?
- We will discuss this after choosing development boards.
 - requirements: swap inferences per condition (e.g. day -> night)
- (Skymizer) Make sure model test set.
 - It depends on which kinds of development boards that we choose.
