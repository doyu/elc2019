- TinyMLaaS, what is it and why (you already have that with nice figures), added with what it means for us, portfolio perspective (how it can augment our offering)
** TinyML?
- venn diagram
** TinyML as-a-Service (TinyMLaaS)?
- architecture diagram
** Why?
- 90% raw sensor data isn't used
** What does this mean for E///?
- With E/// IoT infrastructure(e.g. LwM2M)
- TinyMLaaS enables SMEs to start their AI business
- with sensor devices

* Partners
- List of interesting companies you have contact with, and have on the candidate list
** 3 Types
- AI chip vendor
- ML compiler vendor
- AI service provider
** With NDA
- Skymizer, ML compiler (ONNC)
- Greenwaves, IoT AI chip (GAP8/9)
** Negotiating
- LeapMind, lightweight NN on FPGA
- INFXL, lightweight NN on MCU
** Potential
- Qualcom, LinuxFoundation AI (LFAI) member. LFAI wants to incubate TinyMLaaS
- Arm/NXP/STM, Cortex-M55 with Ethos-M55 (NN accelerator) in 2021

* Our target
What the purpose is for working with these companies and how they could be "used" for us
- AI chip war
 - Diversed hardware evolution(e.g. AI chip) with ML compiler
 - homogeneous cloud/edge vs heterogeneous (AI) IoT
- E/// as a HUB to accomodate them to connect to service providers.
